# This file contains everything I learnt while creating this webpage 

Header
- Position of header is fixed and z-index set to 1 so header can stay at the top of the page while scrolling through page
- Header positioned top and left of 0 so takes up left corner
- Width adjusted to 100% 
- Border around text by putting the text inside a div tag and selectively styling the text 

Banner
- 2 parts to banner - img and text inside image
- Both these elements are contained inside a parent section tag.
- img was first resized to a max-width of 100% so it will adjust to window size
- The parent section tag's position was made to be relative 
- The text was positioned to be absolute so it is removed from normal document flow and placed absolutely inside it's parent container (section)
